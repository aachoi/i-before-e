# i-before-e
Reddit Challenge:

In this challenge I want to create a function that sticks to the famous English spelling rule 
"i before e except after c". 

When we break it down, we recognize that it is two different structures / patterns that we need to account for so that we can abide by the spelling rule.

They are: 

 "not a c"    +  "ie"
 "c"          +  "ei"
